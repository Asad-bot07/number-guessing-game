# 🎮 Number Guessing Game in C++

This is a simple **Number Guessing Game** built using **C++** as part of my **first internship task**. The project helped me apply and practice basic **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in a fun and interactive way.

## 💡 Game Overview

- The computer randomly selects a number between **1 and 100**.
- The player has **3 attempts** to guess the correct number.
- After each guess, the game provides feedback:
  - "Too high" or "Too low"
  - Remaining number of attempts
- If the player guesses correctly, a congratulatory message is shown.
- If not, the correct number is revealed.
- The player can choose to **play again** or **exit**.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used

- **Classes and Objects**
- **Control structures** (if-else, switch)
- **Loops** (for, while)
- **Random number generation**
- **User input/output**

## 📷 Sample Output (Text-based)
---------------WELCOME---------------
     Enter 1 to play the game 
     Enter 2 to exit the game
